Toko Berkah Jaya - Inventory & Sales Management (CLI App)
This is a simple command-line based inventory and sales management system developed using Python.
The app supports:
- Viewing available stock
- Adding new products
- Updating stock and prices
- Deleting items
- Viewing sales history with filtering by item
- 
This project was created as part of my first assignment in a data science bootcamp to practice basic Python programming, logic structuring, and data handling without external databases or frameworks.
